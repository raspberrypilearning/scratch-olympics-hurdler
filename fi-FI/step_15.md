## Mitä seuraavaksi?

In the `misc` directory are lots of objects you can have a play around with. Each can be positioned somewhere on the stage and so long as they move from left to right at the same speed as the hurdles, then they'll help add to the illusion of movement. This section is left up to you. You could make each one an individual sprite and add them in, or perhaps make them costumes of a few sprites which appear randomly! It's really up to you. Have a look at the GIF below to see the effect you can achieve. Don't forget the turtle graphic either, in the `turtle` directory. What could you make him do in the race?
